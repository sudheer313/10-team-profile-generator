## What we learned
I learned few important stuff regarding Jest and unit testing. I also got hands on practice with Oops, classes and most importantly using node.js.
I became more familiar with node, Unit testing and Oops classes most importantly. This assignmnet help me to get experiance with Node, unit testing, Jest tsting

## Challenges
I had no clue how to create classes and do unit testing at first. But when I referred to class tutorials and Jest docs helped me through. I also had a bit trouble to understand the use of classes and exporitng them as modules and using them in inquirer. But after referring  jessamyn27 github repo and understanging the basic concept of inquirer using inquirer like we did in last assignmnet I managed to overcome this challange and very thankful for ASK Bcs who always assisted me throgh out the process. I also thank jessamyn27 and ashachakre0906.
I am also thankful and proud of myself for not giving up and keep trying untill I managed to learn this.
